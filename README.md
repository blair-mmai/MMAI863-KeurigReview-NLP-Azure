 NLP Analysis using Azure and Tensorflow

Assignment lead: Blair Nicolle
Second: Jerry Liu

This assignment was written early on in our Masters program, prior to having formal knowledge
on our team about detailed NLP analysis.

Originally, this assignment tasked us to compare Azure ML Studio with IBM Watson but
technical licensing issues at Queens prevented us from using IBM Watson so we were tasked
to use Tensorflow as a backfill for IBM Watson, which is not a fair, apples-to-apples comparison
as Tensorflow is able to be called as an open source library from Azure ML Studio, for one.  So
in that respect, Azure ML can do everything Tensorflow can plus its own features.

Therefore, this paper decided to focus on how Azure might be implemented in a company with a new
Advanced Analytics 'Center of Excellence.'

The NLP results were quite pale as the training set was very small (500 reviews).  Other groups
merged more group's training sets together (2500 reviews) and didn't obtain significantly different 
results.  So this paper provided its results as they were but the reader shall understand that it 
was in acuality based on a rather dirty, toy dataset.
